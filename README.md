- Built-in *rotational sensor* for precise control.

### *Medium Motor*
- Faster and smaller, suitable for precise and rapid movements.
- Includes a *rotational sensor*.

---

## *3. Sensors*
### *Ultrasonic Sensor* (Distance Measurement)
- Measures distance using sound waves.
- Detects obstacles and measures distance in cm/inches.

### *Color Sensor* (Color & Light Detection)
- Recognizes colors (red, blue, green, etc.).
- Detects light intensity (ambient and reflected).

### *Touch Sensor* (Physical Interaction)
- Works like a button; detects when pressed or released.
- Used for bump detection or triggering actions.

### *Gyro Sensor* (Rotation & Balance)
- Measures the robotâ€™s rotational movement (angular velocity).
- Helps in stabilizing movements and navigation.

### *Infrared Sensor* (Object Detection & Remote Control)
- Detects objects using infrared signals.
- Compatible with the EV3 remote control for wireless operation.
